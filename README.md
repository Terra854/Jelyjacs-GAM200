# Feline Felony

## Overview
**Feline Felony**  is a 2D Puzzle Platformer that has 2 characters for the player to control. The player has to switch between the 2 characters to clear the obstacles and proceed to the next level until the end of the game.

The project is written in C++17 to be able to use language features such as inheritance and polymorphism. This project incorporates the component based architecture which makes it easier to include additional features and make changes to the code without many bugs. In this architecture, we use our systems to update each component that the object can have per game loop. We used inheritance as many of our classes are using the same functions, so we have a few base classes and we built upon them. 


## Story
