GAME CONCEPT

Finn is a teenager struggling to survive in a cyberpunk dystopian world. Having no surviving family members, Finn's closest friend is a robot cat, named Spark, which he found roaming on the streets. However, the cat is surviving on a piece of technology that requires a special chemical to continue functioning.
To prolong the lifetime of the cat, Finn chose to break into the factory that produces the chemical to steal the formula to make that chemical. Will Finn be able to succeed in his mission to save his feline friend?
