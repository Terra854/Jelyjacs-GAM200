Finn is a teenager struggling to survive in a cyberpunk dystopian world. Having no surviving family members, Finn's closest friend is a robot cat, named Spark, which he found roaming on the streets. However, the cat is surviving on a piece of technology that requires a special chemical to continue functioning.
